### Using Keras & Tensorflow to generate midi music pieces

I made [*DeepMelody*](https://ryan-kan.github.io/DeepMelody/) for the sole purpose of generating music easily and quickly. Other programs seem too complex to be used, and I thus taken up the challenge to code something that is my own. That is the origin story of DeepMelody.
